# Automatic Night Lamp System — Web Presentation

This folder contains a single-page website that documents the "Automatic Night Lamp System" built using an LDR sensor and Arduino UNO.

Files:
- `index.html` — the single-page website
- `css/styles.css` — styles and animations
- `js/script.js` — scroll reveal and smooth scrolling
- `arduino/automatic_night_lamp.ino` — example Arduino sketch
- `assets/` — placeholder SVG icons & images

How to preview:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click). For best results, serve from a local server:

   Python 3 (from project folder):

   ```powershell
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

   Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

Next steps:
- Replace placeholder images in `assets/` with your Tinkercad screenshots or real photos.
- Replace team member placeholders with real names and photos.
- Provide your exact Arduino sketch if you want it embedded verbatim.
- (Optional) Deploy to GitHub Pages for presentation.
